# WebsiteProject
The repositary for my 3rd year website project.


I have built this website on the basis of it trying to look formal for a higher end wine bar, hence the simplicity and not too much bulk.

I have used the three.js libraries to render my 3d wine glass on the main page which contains 2 layers, I got the original wine glass mesh free on a stock 3D modelling website, then converted it into javascript, creating the scenes, lighting and camera angles.
