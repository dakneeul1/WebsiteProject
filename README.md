# WebsiteProject
The repositary for my 3rd year website project.


I have built this website on the basis of it trying to look formal for a higher end wine bar, hence the simplicity and not too much bulk.

There is no real 'cork wine bar company', it is an idea I have built for the purpose of this assignment.

I have incorportaed Google maps API, twitter widgets, CSS3, three.js(webGL), js and Jquery.


Originally I had used a dark grey background and winged it with all of the other colours, not finding this too aesthetically pleasing I researched different colour schemes and eventually put together the one used within the website now

Most of the font's used have come from googles font library and are imported at the top of the pages that use them.


Throughout the development process I have been using a google chrome plugin called 'window resizer' this enabled me to resize my browser to the specified devies I have used breakpoints for.

I have used the three.js libraries to render my 3d wine glass on the main page which contains 2 layers, I got the original wine glass mesh free on a stock 3D modelling website, then converted it into javascript, creating the scenes, lighting and camera angles.
